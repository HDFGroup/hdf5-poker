The purpose of this repository is to provide tools elucidating the [HDF5 file format specification](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_f_m_t3.html). This is achieved through a suitable set of GNU poke [pickles](https://www.jemarch.net/poke-3.0-manual/html_node/Pickles.html#Pickles) and [scripts](https://www.jemarch.net/poke-3.0-manual/html_node/Writing-Binary-Utilities.html#Writing-Binary-Utilities).
